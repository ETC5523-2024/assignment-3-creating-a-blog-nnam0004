## Nahar Singh Namdhari

I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Analytics at Monash University, with a deep passion for leveraging data-driven insights to address complex challenges across industries. My academic foundation, along with hands-on experience at Bank of America, where I worked in treasury services, finance, and operations, has honed my ability to think strategically and analytically. At Bank of America, I played a key role in data-driven decision-making, which further fueled my interest in business analytics. I aim to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights to drive innovation and impactful outcomes in the business world.

### Key Interests:

- **Corporate Finance and Investment Banking**: Utilizing analytical expertise to optimize financial decisions and strategies, particularly in high-stakes environments.

- **Open Data & Historical Analysis**: Advocating for the re-use of datasets, ensuring data privacy while promoting transparent and impactful analysis.

- **Cross-Industry Data Application**: Applying data solutions across diverse sectors, from finance to academia, to solve complex, real-world challenges.


I am eager to collaborate on high-impact projects and always open to discussing new ideas where data can make a significant difference.
