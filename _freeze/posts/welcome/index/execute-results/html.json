By 2024, the outcomes are starkly different: while the Roadster depreciated to less than $40,000, Tesla's stock skyrocketed, transforming the same $109,000 into an astonishing $14.39 million. This analysis underscores the significant wealth-building potential of investing in disruptive technologies versus the predictable depreciation of luxury goods.\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn 2010, Tesla was a relatively unknown player in the automotive industry, having just launched its revolutionary but niche Tesla Roadster. At the time, many were skeptical about the company’s long-term viability, and Tesla's newly issued stock, following its IPO (Initial Public Offering), was considered a risky investment. The choice between purchasing an innovative electric vehicle or investing in Tesla’s future presented a clear financial dilemma: should one buy the luxury Tesla Roadster for instant enjoyment, or invest in the company’s ambitious future, despite the risks?\n\n### Methods\n\n#### Data Source\n\nThis analysis relies on two primary data sources:\n\n- **Tesla Stock Data**: Retrieved from [**Yahoo Finance**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history/), the dataset includes adjusted closing prices for Tesla stock spanning from 2010 to 2024. This data was used to compute the investment returns over the 14-year period. To ensure its quality, the dataset was thoroughly examined for completeness, covering the entire timeframe. No missing values or outliers were detected during the review process.\nThe data was downloaded by first clicking on \"Historical Data,\" selecting the desired date range, and then clicking the \"Download\" button.\n  \n- **Tesla Roadster Depreciation Data**: The depreciation data for luxury electric vehicles was sourced from industry-leading platforms, [**Kelley Blue Book**](https://www.kbb.com) and [**Edmunds**](https://www.edmunds.com), both recognized for their accuracy and reliability. To ensure consistency, the data was cross-referenced between the two platforms. It was then applied to a standard depreciation model for luxury electric vehicles in R studio. \n\n#### Variables Description \n\n- **Date**: Represents the specific date on which the stock price was recorded or the valuation of the Tesla Roadster was determined.\n\n- **Adj_Close**: The adjusted closing price of Tesla stock, which factors in corporate actions such as stock splits and dividends.\n\n- **Investment_Value**: The fluctuating value of a $109,000 investment, which is calculated either based on Tesla's stock price or the annual depreciation of the Tesla Roadster.\n\n- **Shares_Purchased**: Indicates the number of Tesla shares that could be acquired with an initial investment of $109,000 made in 2010.\n\n#### Details of Work Done\n\n1. **Stock Investment Calculation**:  \n   - The adjusted closing price of Tesla stock on June 30, 2010, was used to determine the number of shares that could be purchased with the initial $109,000. This amounted to approximately 28,385 shares. The value of this investment was then calculated annually based on the adjusted closing prices for each year, illustrating the exponential growth in value over the 14-year period (see @fig-tesla-stock).\n\n2. **Depreciation Calculation for Tesla Roadster**:  \n   - The Roadster’s initial purchase price of $109,000 in 2010 was subject to a 20% depreciation in the first year, followed by a 10% annual depreciation over the next four years. After this period, the depreciation slowed to 5% per year. By 2020, the car's value began to stabilize, showing a typical depreciation pattern for luxury vehicles over time (see @fig-roadster).\n\n### Key Results\n\n***Tesla Stock Investment***\n\nA $109,000 investment in Tesla stock on June 30, 2010, at an adjusted price of $3.84 per share, would have secured approximately 28,385 shares. By June 30, 2024, this investment would have soared in value to $14.39 million, reflecting a staggering return of over 13,000%. Tesla's meteoric rise from a niche automaker to a global leader in electric vehicles and clean energy illustrates the immense financial rewards of investing early in innovative companies. This 13,000% return underscores the transformative potential of long-term investment strategies, where patience and belief in disruptive technology can result in extraordinary financial gains, as illustrated in @fig-tesla-stock.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![This graph shows the exponential growth of a $109,000 investment in Tesla stock, reaching $14.39 million by 2024, highlighting significant returns over 14 years.](index_files/figure-html/fig-tesla-stock-1.png){#fig-tesla-stock width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n***Tesla Roadster Investment***\n\nIn contrast, the Tesla Roadster, purchased for $109,000 in 2010, followed a typical luxury car depreciation curve. It lost 20% of its value in the first year, 10% annually for the next four years, and then depreciated at a slower rate of 5% per year. By 2024, the Roadster's value had dropped to under $40,000, representing a decline of over 63% from its original price, as illustrated in @tbl-roadster. While the Roadster was a symbol of technological innovation, its financial performance exemplifies the inevitable depreciation of luxury vehicles. This stark contrast highlights the significant disparity in wealth accumulation between an appreciating asset like Tesla stock and a depreciating asset like the car.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-roadster .cell tbl-cap='This graph illustrates the depreciation of the Tesla Roadster from its initial value of $109,000 in 2010 to $44,269 by 2024, showing a steady decline in value over time.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"width: auto !important; \">\n<caption>Tesla Roadster Value Depreciation Over Time</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;\"> Value </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2010-06-30 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: steelblue !important;\"> 109000.00 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2015-06-30 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: steelblue !important;\"> 57211.92 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2020-06-30 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: steelblue !important;\"> 44269.49 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2024-07-01 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;color: white !important;background-color: steelblue !important;\"> 44269.49 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis analysis underscores the stark difference between the financial outcomes of investing in a high-growth company like Tesla and purchasing a luxury asset like the Roadster. While the Roadster provided short-term prestige, it depreciated over time. In contrast, the Tesla stock investment yielded life-changing returns, illustrating the long-term financial benefits of investing in innovative, future-focused companies. In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, betting on disruptive innovation is not only a growth strategy but also a pathway to generational wealth. The takeaway is clear: patience, foresight, and embracing emerging technologies can lead to extraordinary rewards. \n\n### References\n\n- **Gründl, H., M. Dong and J.
